# yaml-shellcheck

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/mschuette/yaml-shellcheck/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/mschuette/yaml-shellcheck)

Wrapper script to run [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) on YAML CI-config files.
Currently supported formats are
[Bitbucket Pipelines](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/configure-bitbucket-pipelinesyml/),
[GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html),
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions),
[Drone CI](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/),
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/),
and (very limited) [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/shell_module.html)

## Usage

### Shell

Needs Python 3 with library [ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/),
and shellcheck.

```text
$ ./yaml_shellcheck.py -h
usage: yaml_shellcheck.py [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [-k] [-d] [-s SHELL] [-c COMMAND] files [files ...]

run shellcheck on script blocks from .gitlab-ci.yml or bitbucket-pipelines.yml

positional arguments:
  files                 YAML files to read

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        output directory (default: create temporary directory)
  -k, --keep            keep (do not delete) output directory
  -d, --debug           debug output
  -s SHELL, --shell SHELL
                        default shebang line to add to shell script snippets (default: '#!/bin/sh -e')
  -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                        shellcheck command to run (default: shellcheck)
```

### Exit Status/Return Values

The tool exits with the exit code from `shellcheck`, from their man page:

    ShellCheck uses the follow exit codes:
    • 0: All files successfully scanned with no issues.
    • 1: All files successfully scanned with some issues.
    • 2: Some files could not be processed (e.g. file not found).
    • 3: ShellCheck was invoked with bad syntax (e.g. unknown flag).
    • 4: ShellCheck was invoked with bad options (e.g. unknown formatter).

### Docker

```shell
# build image
$ docker build . -t yaml_shellcheck:latest
# run image
$ docker run -v `pwd`:/app yaml_shellcheck app/*.yaml
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
lint_yaml_shellcheck:
  image:
    name: quay.io/mschuette/yaml-shellcheck:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - find . -name \*.yaml -or -name \*.yml | xargs python3 /app/yaml_shellcheck.py
```

## File Formats

The main function of this tool is to encode which elements inside the YAML data
contain shell scripts. So far three formats are supported.

### Bitbucket Pipelines

Handling Bitbucket files is very simple. A file with a `pipelines` object
is read as a Bitbucket Pipeline file, and every `script` attribute inside
is considered a shell script.

### GitHub Actions & Forgejo Actions

GitHub has Actions (reusable components) and Workflows (the real CI config
that may run scripts and/or Actions). This tool tries to handle both
file types in the same function.

GitHub Workflows are similar to Bitbucket. A file with a `on` attribute
and a `jobs` object is read as a GitHub file, and every `run` attribute
inside is considered a shell script.

Alternatively a file with an `inputs` and a `runs` object is read as a GitHub Actions file.

As far as I can tell [Forgejo Actions](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/actions/)
(as used e.g. by https://codeberg.org/) intentionally use the same structure as
GitHub Actions/Workflows, so these are covered here as well.

* `shell` attributes are not supported  
this is a todo, it should be simple enough to only check `sh` and `bash` scripts with right shebang line
* [expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions) get replaced with a simple variable before running shellcheck

### Drone CI

Drone CI has a very simple file structure. As far as I can tell it only has
conditions, but no deep nesting or includes. All command lists are concatenated
and checked as a shell script.

### CircleCI

CircleCI has many options, but fortunately the nesting of its `jobs.*.steps.run` script elements is straightforward. All command lists are concatenated and checked as a shell script.

* `shell` attributes are supported  
* [pipeline values and parameters](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/pipeline-variables/) are ignored and replaced with placeholder shell variables

### GitLab CI Pipelines

GitLab CI files have more structure, and we try to support more of it.

* `script`, `before_script`, `after_script`: GitLab has not one, but three different shell script attributes which are read as three independent scripts. In GitLab `before_script` and `script` get concatenated and executed in a single shell process, whereas `after_script` always starts a new shell process. This has some implications for variable visibility etc. and is ignored in this tool.
* `include` is not supported, every YAML file is parsed on its own. For large pipelines with many includes you may want to use other tools to resolve all include and then run yaml_shellcheck on the merged YAML file.
* `!reference` is semi-supported, we only read the tag and insert a placeholder in order not to break the YAML parsing (todo, should be simple to improve).
* decided to _not_ support `variables` checking. `shellcheck` checks lower-case variables for assignments before usage, but it assumes all upper-case variable names are externally provided. -- IMHO GitLab CI jobs should follow that convention and use upper-case variable names for CI/CD variables.

### Ansible

Ansible support is limited. This tool reads Ansible playbook or task files with YAML lists.

So far it recognizes three kinds of list elements:
* Tasks using the `shell` (or `ansible.builtin.shell`) [module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-shell-module).
* Playbook elements, containing a `tasks` attribute.
* [Blocks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_blocks.html) (`block`) for nested task lists.
* Jinja expressions (`{{ ... }}`) are ignored and replaced with placeholder shell variables.

### Common

Files are read with a YAML parser, so all YAML anchors are resolved.
There is no additional check on data types or structure.

Following the Bitbucket/GitLab usage a script block may contain a string or an
array of strings.
